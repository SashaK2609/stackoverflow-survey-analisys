## Discription
For this assignment I analized latest 2024 survey where over 65,000 developers responded to annual [Stackooverflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/) survey about coding, working, AI and how they feel about all of those topics and more. I used Google Colab to work with this file and answered main questions:

- Define main measures of central tendency for Work Experience for all respondents.
- How many respondents work remotely?
- How many respondents use Python?
- How many respondents were studying using online courses?
- What is the sum and median of Compensation for Python developers grouped by country?
- What is the education level of 5 respondents with the highest compensation?
- In each age category, what is the percentage of respondents use Python?
- What are the most popular industries among respondents that work remotely and their compensation is in 75th percentile?

## Usage
I imported the file from Google Drive. Used pandas libriry with its methods to answer all the questions above.
